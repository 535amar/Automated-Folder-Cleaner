A Python script to organize files into folders based on file extension
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. How It Works
----------------------------------
 - Scans the current directory.
 - For each file 
          = Checks its extension.
          = Creates a folder (if it doesn't exist) named after the extension.
          = Moves the file to that folder.
 - Ignores .py, .md, .txt files by default.


2. Dependencies
---------------------------------
 - only requires Python3.
 - No external packages.

3. Future Improvements
----------------------------------
 - Add GUI with 'Tkinter' or PyQt.
 - Option to select directory

4. Known Issues
----------------------------------
 - Files with no extension are not handled.

4. Personal NOTES = This is useful for cleaning download folders
